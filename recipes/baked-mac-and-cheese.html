         <p>Were you expecting this recipe to be stolen? You would be right! Like before I will credit/link the original recipe at the bottom.
            I'm not the biggest fan of mac and cheese but I do LOVE baked mac and cheese and I will be making some now because of this project!
            If you try the recipe let me know how it was and then add it to every meal! I mean just think about that cheesy goodness that would send even the most complex tastebuds into euphoria.
            Bake it today!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
         <li>Elbow Macaroni</li>
         <li>Butter and Flour</li>
         <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Cheese (Cheddar is preferred but any melting cheese will do)</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Boil The macaroni noodles:</b> Boil the macaroni for 2 minutes less than your packaging says for al dente as they will cook more in the oven.</li>
        <li><b>Make the cheese sauce:</b> Cook flour in melted butter until golden, whisk in milk or half-and-half, bring the sauce to a boiil, and cook until thickened.
        Remove from heat and whisk in shredded cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Layer with more cheese:</b> Pour half of the mac and cheese into a baking dish, add a layer of shredded cheese, top with the remaining mac and cheese, and finish with even more cheese.</li>
        <li><b>Bake the mac and cheese:</b> Bake just until bubbling around the edges and the cheese melts and turns golden-brown in spots. Baking time should be 20-30 minutes for refrigerated cheese and 10 minutes if not.</li>
    </ol>
