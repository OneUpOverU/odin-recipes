    <P>This is a chicken recipe I stole! I will end up providing a link to the original recipe to give credit at the bottom of the page.
        I haven't tried this chicken myself but DAMN do I love me some crispy chicken. I would add a few more seasonings but this doesn't seem to be terrible.
        You should try it and then update me. Chicken is a simple meal and we are but simple creatures and we yearn for it's golden-brown crunch. Try this recipe today!
